                The Children‚Äôs Online Privacy and Protection Act (‚ÄúCOPPA‚Äù)
                requires that online service providers obtain clear and
                verifiable parental consent before collecting personal
                information from children under 13. Because CodeFlow provides
                its Service to Schools to support educational programs, CodeFlow
                relies on Schools to obtain and provide appropriate consent, if
                necessary, for collecting student information.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Schools represent and warrant that they have obtained all
                required consents before allowing students under 13 to access
                the Service and have provided appropriate disclosures to parents
                and guardians. We recommend Schools provide a copy of our
                Privacy Policy to parents and guardians. Please email
